Normal debugging / logging without using quit() all the time.

Internal event system: defines a number of events and allows to hook callbacks to them.
This will reduce number of references between units: simplier and cleaner code, more bug-proof.

Every struct should have a read/write (or serialize/unserialize) methods.

There should be interfaces wrapping low-level functionality to be used instead of raw FILE or BITMAP
references.
