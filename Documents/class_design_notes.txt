Normal debugging / logging without using quit() all the time.

Internal event system: defines a number of events and allows to hook callbacks to them.
This will reduce number of references between units: simplier and cleaner code, more bug-proof.

Every struct should have a read/write (or serialize/unserialize) methods.

There should be interfaces wrapping low-level functionality to be used instead of raw FILE or BITMAP
references.




What classes do we need? Thoughts -

Engine - obviously, at least for init and main loop.
Game
Room
Character
Object (RoomObject)
Hotspot
Region

Speech/ConversationManager (Speech/ConversationController) - implements speech style (lucas art, sierra etc)
