There is a bunch of paired types with one unit of a pair being a struct
Script*something and another being struct CC*something, a child of
struct AGSCCDynamicObject.

In other word, we may say there's a pair of DynamicObject and ScriptObject.

Example: *AudioClip, *AudioChannel.

On other hand there are types called Script*something that are derived from
AGSCCDynamicObject on their own.

Example: ScriptViewFrame, ScriptDynamicSprite

Why such composition and how it works?
