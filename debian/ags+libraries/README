This archive includes Linux binaries of AGS and all required shared
libraries, for the i386 and amd64 architectures. It can be used to create
game releases for Linux that should work on most modern Linux systems.

To create a game release, copy the game into the "data" directory. Now it
should be possible to start the game using the script "startgame". This
script may be renamed to the name of the game.

For games using MIDI music, a patches file has to be included.
(Todo: make sure it is found.)

This bundle was created using the script debian/make_ags+libraries.sh from
the AGS repository at https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags
