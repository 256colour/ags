// This is originally a part of acroom.h, that was put under CROOM_NOFUNCTIONS
// macro control and enabled when CROOM_NOFUNCTIONS was set.
// This should be included INSTEAD of acroom.h in the source files that
// previously included acroom.h with CROOM_NOFUNCTIONS define.
// There's no need to include both acroom.h and acroom_nofunc.h, since latter
// includes acroom.h on its own.
// CROOM_NOFUNCTIONS macro is being removed since no longer needed.
