/*
 'C'-style script compiler development file. (c) 2000,2001 Chris Jones

 SCOM is a script compiler for the 'C' language. The current version
 implements:
  * #define macros, definition of and use of
  * "//" and "/*---* /" comments
  * global and local variables; calling functions; assignments
  * most of the standard 'C' operators
  * structures and arrays
  * import and export of variables and functions from parent program
  * strings get allocated 200 bytes of storage automatically

 It currently does NOT do:
  * #define with parenthesis, eg. #define func(a) bar(a+3)
  * typedefs
  * optimize code generated - it could check if MAR already contains location
      to read, for example

 Some interesting points about how this works:
  * while loops are stored internally as "else"-blocks, but with an extra
    bit of data storing the start of the while test condition to go back to
  * array index accesses are generated as code to allow anything inside
    the brackets, whereas structure member accesses are hardcoded into the
    offset in the code since the member has a fixed offset from the structure
    start
